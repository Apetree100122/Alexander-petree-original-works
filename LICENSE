Everyone is permitted to copy
and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document
but changing it is not allowed
Preamble
The GNU Affero General Public License is a free 
copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works
specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software
 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works
By contrast
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users
  When we speak of free software
we are referring to freedom
**not price**
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software
that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs
and that you know you can do these things
 Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: 
(1) assert copyright on the software
and 
(2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy
distribute and/or modify the software
  A secondary benefit of defending all users
freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program
if they
receive widespread use
become available for other developers to
incorporate
Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation
However
in the case of
software used on network servers
this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public
  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that
in such cases
the modified source code becomes available
to the community
It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server
Therefore
public use of a modified version
on
a publicly accessible server
gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version
  An older license
called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero
was designed to accomplish similar goals
This is
a different license
not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license
  The precise terms and conditions for copying
distribution and
modification follow
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Definitions.
  "This License" refers to version 3 of 
the GNU Affero General Public License
"Copyright" also means 
copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works
such as semiconductor masks
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work 
licensed under this
License
Each licensee is addressed as "you"
"Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations
 To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all 
or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission
other than the making of an
exact copy
The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program
To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy
Propagation includes copying
distribution making available to the
public
and in some countries other activities as well.
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies
Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy
is not conveying
  An interactive user interface displays 
"Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that 
(1) displays an appropriate copyright notice
and 
(2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work 
that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License
If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options
such as a
menu
a prominent item in the list meets this criterion
 1. Source Code.
  The "source code" for a work means
the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it
"Object.defineProperty code"
means any non-source
form of a work
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body
or
in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language
one that
is widely used among developers working in that language
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything
other
than the work as a whole
that (a) 
is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component
but which is not part of that Major
Component
and (b)
serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component
or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form
A
"Major Component"
in this context
means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs
or a compiler used to
produce the work
or an object code interpreter used to run it
